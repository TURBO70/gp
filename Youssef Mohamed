"Shazam for Quran is an app designed for learning the Quran and detecting mistakes. It also includes a Shazam-like feature for voice detection."

what i dont understand:

- Is it feasible to develop this within one year?
- What about AI?
- Do we have enough datasets?
- What tech stack will be used?
