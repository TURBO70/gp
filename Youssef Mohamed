What I Understand:

- This app is like an AI mentor for the Quran. It takes your voice and detects mistakes. It also has a Shazam-like feature to identify the sheikh's voice and tell you which surah it is.

What I Don't Understand:

- How difficult is it?
- Can we accomplish it within one year?
- Are the databases we have sufficient?
- AI models.
